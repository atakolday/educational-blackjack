## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd blackjack
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the game:**

   **Console Interface:**
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

   **Graphical Interface:**
   ```bash
   python3 gui_main.py
   ```
   
   **Note:** The GUI requires tkinter. If you get a "No module named '_tkinter'" error, install it with:
   ```bash
   # On macOS with Homebrew:
   brew install python-tk
   
   # On Ubuntu/Debian:
   sudo apt-get install python3-tk
   
   # On Windows:
   # tkinter is usually included with Python installation
   ```

## Building a Standalone App

To create a standalone macOS app that you can double-click to run:

### Option 1: Simple Build (Recommended)
```bash
python build_app_simple.py
```

### Option 2: Full Build with DMG
```bash
python build_app.py
```

After building, you'll find your app at:
- **Simple build**: `dist/Blackjack` (executable file)
- **Full build**: `dist/Blackjack.app` (macOS app bundle)

### Features of the Standalone App:
- âœ… **No Python required** - runs independently
- âœ… **Custom icon** - uses your game icon
- âœ… **Native macOS app** - appears in Dock, Applications folder
- âœ… **All assets included** - no missing files
- âœ… **Professional appearance** - looks like a real app

### Installing the App:
1. **Test**: Double-click the app to make sure it works
2. **Install**: Drag `Blackjack.app` to your Applications folder
3. **Launch**: Use Spotlight (Cmd+Space) and type "Blackjack"
4. **Dock**: The app will appear in your Dock when running

## How to Play

### Console Interface
The current version includes a fully functional console interface:

### Graphical Interface
The GUI provides a modern, user-friendly interface with:

- **Start Screen** with bankroll selection and game rules
- **Professional card design** with realistic proportions and styling
- **Real-time card display** with suit symbols and colors
- **Live count tracking** showing running count, true count, and count status
- **Strategy recommendations** displaying optimal actions and expected values
- **Interactive betting** with quick bet buttons and bankroll management
- **Game action buttons** (hit, stand, double, split, surrender) that update based on game state
- **Insurance handling** when dealer shows an Ace
- **Game statistics** including win rate and games played
- **Responsive layout** that adapts to different window sizes
- **Menu navigation** with back-to-menu functionality

The GUI automatically updates all displays in real-time as the game progresses, providing immediate feedback on count changes and strategy recommendations.

1. **Place a bet:** `bet 50`
2. **Take actions during play:**
   - `hit` - Take another card
   - `stand` - Keep current hand
   - `double` - Double down (if available)
   - `split` - Split the hand (if available)
   - `surrender` - Surrender the hand (if available)
3. **Start new hand:** `new`
4. **Quit:** `quit`

### Card Counting
The game automatically tracks the Hi-Lo count:
- **+1:** 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- **0:** 7, 8, 9
- **-1:** 10, J, Q, K, A

The running count and true count are displayed during gameplay.

## Technical Details

### Card Counting System
The game implements the Hi-Lo counting system, which is one of the most popular and effective card counting methods:

- **Low cards (2-6):** +1 to count
- **Neutral cards (7-9):** 0 to count  
- **High cards (10-A):** -1 to count

The **true count** is calculated as: `running_count / decks_remaining`

### Probability Calculations
The system tracks exact card composition of the remaining deck, enabling precise probability calculations for:
- Drawing specific ranks
- Busting probabilities
- Dealer outcome probabilities
- Expected values for all actions

### Strategy Optimization
Unlike basic strategy (which assumes infinite deck), this system calculates optimal play based on the actual remaining deck composition, providing a significant advantage when the count is favorable.
